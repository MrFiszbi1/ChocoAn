# ChocoAn
ChocoAn was the name given to a theoretical company we used as the bases for creating our project. The project was designed for this theoretical company. This project was designed for us to experience the Software Development Life Cycle. As such the project was not fully completed by the end of the term. Each member has a branch with the code they wrote on it. My branch is named Jaafar.
